Javascript files for a simple draw application(try it out at http://picturethis.heroku.com/). 

main.js is the file which gets loaded first which sets up the initializations.

pag.js contains the PagManager class which takes care of interaction with the canvas(and its contexts) as well as redirecting the click events to corresponding draw classes.

Various *Draw.js files are classes which take care of the handling the drawing. The classes themselves take care of handling events for now.

Undo is not implemented.
